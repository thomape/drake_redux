          Within the astronomical community there are many interesting
          scientific equations that help humankind better understand the space
          in which we occupy. Everything from the vastness of the cosmos above
          all the way down to the quarks that perform seemingly impossible
          feats. Some of the science is so well proven that it governs nearly
          everything we do and perceive, such as Einstein’s general and special
          relativity equations. There also exists, formulas or thought
          experiments that border on the line between astronomy and philosophy.
          This site is dedicated to those experiments.

          The Drake equation, while not a strong scientific model to stand on,
          gives use the ability to imagine about the possibilities that may
          exist. It also has the power to curb any over-zealous tendencies that
          human emotion may lend. At its core, the Drake equation is a set of
          seven parameters that allow us to calculate the possibility of life
          within the universe.

          Fermi’s paradox doesn’t include any type of mathematical calculation
          or scientific experiments, but it does compliment the Drake equation
          nicely. The premise is that; if the universe is infinite, why then
          haven’t we encountered any species other than what is familiar to use
          here on Earth? This is a thought experiment that helps us contemplate
          possible reasons for this phenomenon.

          The Twin paradox has a great deal of math and science surrounding it.
          However, the concept is particularly difficult to relate to for many.
          Much of this has to do with human ego and one’s perception of their
          universe. The fundamental concept is that if one twin went on an epic
          space journey and the other remained behind on Earth their perception
          of time would be very different. The two primary factors at play are
          the speed of the traveling twin and the distance from the twin left on
          Earth.

          The last section isn’t so much about science and math, but a simple
          demonstration of how vast space truly is. We have been conditioned
          through popular media and movies to believe that traveling to Saturn
          or the closest galaxy is as simple as saying a catchy punch line and
          then being transported through space while white streaks of light pass
          by the ship’s windows. While this would be ideal, and in some areas of
          research this is the goal, but the hard reality is that this is far
          more difficult to achieve than just building a super-fast ship. In
          some sects the belief is that, given our current understanding of
          science it is impossible and will only exist on the silver screens.
