            The Drake equation is comprised seven varibles. Each varible has a
            useful range which allows for semi-realistic predictions. The
            original estimates and the current estimates vary greatly and that
            is simply because some of the varibles which were purely assumptions
            when the equation was concienved, have now been changed by sceince.

            The calculator has a few options to demostrate the aformentioned
            varibility. It also provideds a guided experience which will help
            the user understand the ranges that make sense supported by our
            current sceintific knowledge. The user-defined option will allow for
            any input, ambitious or otherwise.

            It should also be mentioned that the Drake equation was never
            intended to be used for sceintific research purposes, but rather as
            and ice breaker for the first SETI convention meeting. Its intial
            purpose was simply designed as an exercise to escape personal ego or
            beliefs and stimulate productive conversation. Until science has
            narrowed in on all of these varibles the equation's initial purpose
            should still be observed.
